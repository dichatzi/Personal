>> The following instructions aim aid the user for successfully installing the pip package in the GAMS python subfolder and then successfully installing 
>> other packages (i.e. the "requests" package)


1. Download the get-pip.py file from the following url: 
   https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

2. Save the file in any directory

3. Run the file using the python version of the GAMS subsystem, i.e. assuming that the current directory is the one containing the get-pip.py file:
   "C://GAMS//34//GMSPython//python.exe" get-pip.py	(full cmd line: 'C:\GAMS\get-pip>"C://GAMS//34//GMSPython//python.exe" get-pip.py')

4. After the successful pip installation we can install the required packages by running the follwing commands:
   "C:\GAMS\34\GMSPython\Scripts\pip.exe" install XXXXXX

   where XXXXXX denotes the package name (i.e. for the "requests" package the full cmd line is: 'C:\GAMS\get-pip>"C:\GAMS\34\GMSPython\Scripts\pip.exe" install requests')
